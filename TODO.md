# Laundry list for possible actions

- write a Makefile allowing: `make build astroml`
- configure these automatically created directories to somewhere less intrusive than just `$HOME`
 `migrated astropy matplotlib yarn lab pip fontconfig serverconfig jedi numba`
- launcher in jupyterlab has too many launching tabs
- make automatic launcher given a conda environment
- install jupyterlab extensions in home directory rather than /opt/conda
- build npm apps on container directories to avoid populating million of useless files
- environments in home directory with pip by default
- add other alternative notebooks such as querybook, cocalc, nteract_on_jupyter
